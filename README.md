# CambiaApp
<p>Cambia is a card game that combines memory, quickness, and strategy. My friends play it from time to time and have gotten pretty good at it. 
One day, we noticed that the internet has nothing about the card game. There are other card games that are similar, but none with the exact
rules to which we play (or has the same name). I found it to be a great oppurtunity to practice and learn about android development while
also being something that my friends and I can enjoy play testing. </p>
<p>This is my first android project. I am using cambia as a way to learn as much about android development as I can. As of now (August 2017),
Cambia is a pass and play game where one device is used to play the game. It is also, as of now, turn based. Once I get the app to a place
where I am content with its place, I will begin expanding the game to be a realtime multiplayer game (This, in itself, is a project of its
own). </p>
<p>I will be creating a tutorial on how to play Cambia, both in real life as well as on the app. Once everything is completed, I will be adding
the app onto Google Play. It has been a blast creating and learning and I hope anyone who uses the app gets as much fun playing as I have
had creating.</p>
